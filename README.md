# Cursor 2.0 Todo Playground

Welcome! This lightweight todo manager is a showcase project demonstrating how quickly a polished experience can come together with Cursor 2.0 at the wheel. It was designed, built, and refined in just a few hours as a warmup challenge to explore the platform's collaborative coding power.

## What You Can Do

- Sign in securely with email or Google and keep your list private to you
- Capture new tasks in seconds, then edit, complete, or remove them as life changes
- Flip between light and dark modes to match your workspace vibe
- Enjoy instant syncing across devices thanks to real-time cloud storage

## Why It Exists

This app isn't meant to be a production monster; it's a focused experiment. The goal was to validate how quickly Cursor 2.0 can help craft a full-stack experience with authentication, persistence, and a polished UI. The result is a friendly todo tool that proves the point: rapid iteration can still feel intentional and delightful.

## Technology Highlights

- Next.js App Router powers the modern React experience
- Auth.js (NextAuth) manages sessions and adapters for credential and Google login
- Firebase Authentication keeps sign-in simple and secure
- Cloud Firestore stores todos per user and streams real-time updates
- Tailwind CSS and next-themes provide responsive styling with instant theme switching
- TypeScript threads everything together with strong typing and predictable data flow
- Cypress ensures core flows stay reliable through end-to-end and component tests

## Want to Explore Locally?

Developers who want to poke around can clone the repo, install dependencies with `npm install`, and launch the dev server via `npm run dev`. The app will greet you at `http://localhost:3000` with the same experience showcased here.

Thanks for dropping by! Whether you’re scouting ideas or just checking out Cursor 2.0’s capabilities, this warmup project is ready to inspire your next build.
